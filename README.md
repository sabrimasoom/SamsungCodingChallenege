Android UI Coding Challenge

1.	The purpose of this exercise is to build a Gallery App in Android. We have provided sample photo assets organized in 5 folders, namely “Animals”, “Architecture”, “Food”, “Posters” and “Scenery”. A folder represents an album and the photos in the folder represent photos in the album. All photos have the same resolutions that are 1280 X 1280. 
2.	The main activity of the application shows a list view of albums, presented by a cropped image of the first photo of the album, with a text overlay showing the name of the album (which is the name of the folder). The list supports vertical scrolling. 
3.	As the image is touched by the user a new page is opened. The new page contains a list view of all photos in the album. The list is vertically scrollable. The user can touch either the physical back button or the arrow at the top left corner to go back to the main activity. 
4.	On the main activity, the user can long-press an image and expand it to a 1:1 preview. On the preview image, the user can scroll among all photos in the same album by moving the finger horizontally. The preview is closed when the finger is lifted off the screen.
